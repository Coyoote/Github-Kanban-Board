# GitHub Kanban Board

With this application, users can monitor issues for their GitHub repository by leveraging the GitHub API. The application provides a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that includes three columns: ToDo (for new issues), In Progress (for opened issues with assignees), and Closed (for closed issues). Additionally, the application saves the current position of each issue (its column and order) between browser sessions, allowing users to easily continue their work from where they left off.
